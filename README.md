## F1 Racing Analysis
### Is there a better driver than the winner?
<b> Analysis done by Keith Faunce </b>


#### This is a statistical study done purely for fun and has no implications on Formula 1
<p> In the world of F1, over the last set of years there has been this "debate". If these winning drivers
(notabely Verstappen & Hamilton) are winning because of their talent, or their car? Lando Norris himself
has even taken part of this, with subtle remarks towards Lewis Hamilton and his car. With situations
like these arising, I've taken it upon myself to measure driver success in a different format. Putting emphasis
on overtakes from Murray Walker's phrase: "catching is one thing, passing is another". </p>


### Measuring Sucess

<b> How it works </b>
<p> Driver success is measured using a points system. Points are awarded based upon various metrics from
the race, these metrics can yield positive and negative points. </p>

<b> The Metrics </b>
<p> Positive: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Qualifying placement</li>
  <li>Average lap time</li>
  <li>Best lap time</li>
  <li>Laps leading</li>
  <li>Overtakes</li>
</ul>
<p> Negative: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Pit stops</li>
  <li>Overtakes</li>
</ul>
